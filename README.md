# Jobs

## Introduction
Welcome to Jobs! This document will guide you through the steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites
- PHP (recommended version 8.2>)
- Composer
- MySQL (or another supported database)
- Git

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alifertah/jobs
   ``` 
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    
    
    `cd project-name` 
    
3.  Install PHP dependencies using Composer:
    
    
    `composer install` 
    
4.  Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:
    
    `cp .env.example .env` 
    
5.  Generate the application key:
    
    `php artisan key:generate` 
    
6.  Configure the `.env` file with your database credentials and other settings.
    
7.  Create the necessary database tables by running the migrations:
    
    `php artisan migrate` 
    
8.  Optionally, seed the database with dummy data:
    
    `php artisan db:seed` 
    
9.  Serve the application locally:
    
    `php artisan serve` 
    
10.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL shown in the terminal after running `php artisan serve`).
    

## Additional Notes

-   For production deployment, make sure to set up your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to point to the `public` directory of the project.
-   Remember to update the `.env` file with appropriate configurations for different environments (local, staging, production).

## Troubleshooting

-   If you encounter any issues during setup or running the project, refer to the official Laravel documentation or seek help from the project's contributors.
